									<p style="margin: 0cm; vertical-align: baseline;"><span style="font-size: 11pt;">Varanasi is one of the seven holy cities for Hindus, and it is truly a sight to behold. It can be an exhausting, liberating, and uninhibited experience all at the same time. The colossal temples, ghats, and other popular places to visit in Varanasi attract millions of tourists year after year. Not only is it a popular destination among Indian travelers, but foreigners love it too. Although Varanasi is most famous for its ghats, temples and music, there are many other amazing places to see and experience in this historic city. As the oldest city in India, Varanasi is full of culture and is one of the holiest cities in the country. Many famous Indian writers, like Tulsidas, wrote their great works here. The city is also known for its beautiful gold and silver threadwork, wooden toys, carpet weaving, glass bangles, perfumes, and a variety of handicrafts and artistic brass ware. So make sure to explore all that Varanasi has to offer on your next trip to India. Varanasi is a city of spiritualism. The people who live there follow their great culture and traditions. They believe that they are blessed by God and that&#8217;s why they have the chance to live in Varanasi. </span><span style="font-size: 11pt;"> </span></p><p style="margin: 0cm; vertical-align: baseline;"><span style="font-size: 9.0pt; font-family: 'Segoe UI',sans-serif;"> </span></p><p style="margin: 0cm; vertical-align: baseline;"><span style="font-size: 11pt;">Street food in Varanasi is as elaborate as the city&#8217;s history. And Varanasi is as old as time itself. Since Aryan culture is found in the holy city, meat and beef is not that common and vegetarian cuisine is mostly followed with some exceptions due to Muslim habitations. The food of Varanasi is influenced by nearby states including Bihar and West Bengal, which has been given a different flavour by the locals of the city. </span><span style="font-size: 11pt;"> </span></p><p style="margin: 0cm; vertical-align: baseline;"><span style="font-size: 11pt;"> </span></p><p style="margin: 0cm; vertical-align: baseline;"><span style="font-size: 11pt;">Unless one savours the culinary treats of Banaras, a trip is incomplete. Food is a quintessential part of Varanasi&#8217;s culture. Being frequented by hundreds of thousands of foreign tourists throughout the year, the city&#8217;s cuisine is a spin-off between the new and the old, the modern and the old-fashioned. A few handpicked locations and special treats will tickle your taste buds while you&#8217;re in Varanasi. </span><span style="font-size: 11pt;"> </span></p><p style="margin: 0cm; vertical-align: baseline;"><span style="font-size: 13pt;"> </span><span style="font-size: 13pt;"> </span></p><p style="margin: 0cm; vertical-align: baseline;"><b><span style="font-size: 13pt;">Places to visit.</span></b><span style="font-size: 13pt;"> </span></p><p style="margin: 0cm; vertical-align: baseline;"><span style="font-size: 11pt;"> </span><span style="font-size: 11pt;"> </span></p><p style="margin: 0cm; vertical-align: baseline;"><b><span style="font-size: 11pt;">Ghats:</span></b><span style="font-size: 11pt;"> Around 84 ghats at the bank of the river Ganga are welcoming the city and increase its value of attraction.

From the era, this city has been referred to as the city of temples, the holy city of God in India, the most religious city of India, the city of lights and learning, city of old culture and tradition and one of the oldest living cities on the earth. </p><p>Varanasi is renowned for its riverfront, with miles of ghats (steps) for religious bathing and an array of shrines, temples, and palaces rising tier on tier from the water&#8217;s edge. The city&#8217;s inner streets are narrow, winding, and impassable for motor traffic; the newer outer suburbs are more spacious and are laid out more systematically. In terms of historical significance, Varanasi is one of the oldest continuously inhabited cities in the world and is also considered to be a holy city by Hindus, Buddhists, and Jains. </p><p>Varanasi is an ancient city with a long and rich history, dating back to the time of the Buddha in the 6th century BCE. The city was the capital of the kingdom of Kashi during that time, and it was here that the Buddha gave his first sermon at Sarnath. Varanasi remained an important centre of religious, educational, and artistic activity for centuries after that, as attested by the famous Chinese Buddhist pilgrim Xuanzang, who visited it in about 635 CE. </p><p>Among the city’s numerous temples, three of the most venerated are those of Vishvanatha (Vishwanath) dedicated to Shiva, Hanuman; and Durga. The Durga Temple is especially famous for the swarms of monkeys that inhabit the large trees near it. Visitors to the temple often feed the monkeys, which has led to some problems with the monkeys becoming aggressive and biting people. Other prominent religious buildings in the city include the Great Mosque of Aurangzeb and two modern temples &#8211; Tulasi Manas and Vishvanatha on the campus of Banaras Hindu University. </p><p>For centuries, Varanasi has been a renowned center of Hindu learning and culture. There are countless schools and learned scholars who have kept traditional knowledge alive. Three universities are located in the city, including the world-famous Banaras Hindu University (1915). In addition, there are more than a dozen colleges and high schools. Varanasi is especially renowned for its arts and crafts, music and dance. The city is especially famous for its silk and brocade fabrics with gold and silver thread work. </p><p><strong>Resorts in Varanasi</strong> </p><p><img decoding="async" class="wp-image-600 size-full aligncenter" src="https://ramadagorakhpurgorakhnath.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/aa.jpg" alt="" width="352" height="219" srcset="https://ramadagorakhpurgorakhnath.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/aa.jpg 352w, https://ramadagorakhpurgorakhnath.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/aa-300x187.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 352px) 100vw, 352px" /></p><p>There are a few things to keep in mind when choosing a resort in Varanasi<strong><em>.</em></strong> First, make sure that it is conveniently located near famous attractions.
